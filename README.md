# Sort_wars

Evaluating and optimizing sorting algorithms using Python

## Overview

Sort_wars is a project dedicated to comparing and optimizing various sorting algorithms. This project aims to provide insights into the performance and efficiency of different sorting techniques using Python.

## Features

- Implementation of multiple sorting algorithms
- Performance evaluation of sorting algorithms
- Visualization of sorting processes
- Optimization techniques for improving sorting efficiency

## Algorithms Implemented

- Bubble Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Selection Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
- Heap Sort

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed on your machine. You can download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Asif-ibrahim101/Sort_wars.git
   cd Sort_wars
   ```

2. (Optional) Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To run the sorting algorithms and evaluate their performance, execute the following command:
```bash
python main.py
```
